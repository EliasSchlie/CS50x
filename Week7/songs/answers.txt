I would characterize the persons "Audio aura" as "Sad, but still dancing" as the average valence is quite low, but the danceability still high.

This way of calculating it might not be perfect, because it just takes the 100 favorite songs into account.
Better would be to use a database with all songs the user listened to and calculate the averages from all those songs multiplied by how often the user listened to them.
