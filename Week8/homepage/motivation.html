    <h2>Why I Want to Solve Aging</h2>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>
      I genuinely believe it's possible to solve aging. There are people actively working on it, 
      and I want to be a part of that effort. Over <strong>110,000 people die every day</strong>. 
      Many argue that aging is inevitable, but what if it isn’t? What if we can treat it like 
      any other condition and make death from old age optional?
    </p>
    <p>
      The main objections to solving aging often revolve around ethics, feasibility, and 
      practical concerns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>"I don’t want to live forever!"</strong><br>
        Nobody will force you. Making death optional is about having the freedom to choose 
        when and in what state you die.</li>
      <li><strong>"It’s unnatural."</strong><br>
        Modern medicine itself is often ‘unnatural.’ Yet, it saves countless lives, including 
        children with cancer.</li>
      <li><strong>Overpopulation concerns</strong><br>
        This is <em>extremely unlikely</em> to be an insurmountable problem. Human innovation 
        has repeatedly expanded our resource capacities.</li>
      <li><strong>"Only the rich will have access."</strong><br>
        The value of an aging cure or geroprotective treatments is so large that it’s unlikely 
        governments and society would exclude the majority.</li>
      <li><strong>"I don't matter, nothing matters."</strong><br>
        If we embrace a perspective that nothing truly matters, then why not choose 
        a life path that excites you? Working on longevity can mean more time to explore 
        and understand this existence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ultimately, I want to see humanity transcend these biological limitations. I want 
      to witness what is possible when our lifespans are extended indefinitely, allowing 
      us to explore new frontiers in technology, knowledge, and even the far reaches 
      of space.
